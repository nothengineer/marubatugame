# Marubatugame
 
"Marubatugame" is a simple game I played when I was in elementary school or junior high school.

# Production environment

# Production background

I thought that if I tried to make a game by programming that I played to kill time when I was in elementary school or junior high school, I would be able to realize my technical improvement.
 
# Ingenious points
 
Of course, it was difficult to make the button "Play again" appear after the draw was confirmed.
It is also a device.

# Technology used
 
mac os

Ruby,HTML/CSS,javascript

heroku

github

VScode
 
# Functions you want to implement in the future
 
In the future, we would like to implement a CPU battle function (difficulty level selection) and a battle record recording function.
 
 
Thank you!
